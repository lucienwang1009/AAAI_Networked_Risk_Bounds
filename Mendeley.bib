@article{Ralaivola2009,
abstract = {PAC-Bayes bounds are among the most accurate generalization bounds for classifiers learned from independently and identically distributed (IID) data, and it is particularly so for margin classifiers: there have been recent contributions showing how practical these bounds can be either to perform model selection (Ambroladze et al., 2007) or even to directly guide the learning of linear classifiers (Germain et al., 2009). However, there are many practical situations where the training data show some dependencies and where the traditional IID assumption does not hold. Stating generalization bounds for such frameworks is therefore of the utmost interest, both from theoretical and prac- tical standpoints. In this work, we propose the firstto the best of our knowledgePAC-Bayes generalization bounds for classifiers trained on data exhibiting interdependencies. The approach undertaken to establish our results is based on the decomposition of a so-called dependency graph that encodes the dependencies within the data, in sets of independent data, thanks to graph frac- tional covers. Our bounds are very general, since being able to find an upper bound on the fractional chromatic number of the dependency graph is sufficient to get new PAC-Bayes bounds for specific settings. We show how our results can be used to derive bounds for ranking statistics (such as AUC) and classifiers trained on data distributed according to a stationary -mixing process. In the way, we show how our approach seamlessly allows us to deal with U-processes. As a side note, we also provide a PAC-Bayes generalization bound for classifiers learned on data from stationary -mixing distributions.},

We extend Tsybakov's analysis of the risk of an ERM under margin type conditions by using concentration inequalities for conveniently weighted empirical processes. This allows us to deal with other ways of measuring the size of a class of classifiers than entropy with bracketing as in Tsybakov's work. In particular we derive new risk bounds for the ERM when the classification rules belong to some VC-class under margin conditions and discuss the optimality of those bounds in a minimax sense.},

abstract = {A general method for obtaining moment inequalities for functions of independent random variables is presented. It is a generalization of the entropy method which has been used to derive concentration inequalities for such functions [Boucheron, Lugosi and Massart Ann. Probab. 31 (2003) 1583-1614], and is based on a generalized tensorization inequality due to Latala and Oleszkiewicz [Lecture Notes in Math. 1745 (2000) 147-168]. The new inequalities prove to be a versatile tool in a wide range of applications. We illustrate the power of the method by showing how it can be used to effortlessly re-derive classical inequalities including Rosenthal and Kahane-Khinchine-type inequalities for sums of independent random variables, moment inequalities for suprema of empirical processes and moment inequalities for Rademacher chaos and U-statistics. Some of these corollaries are apparently new. In particular, we generalize Talagrand's exponential inequality for Rademacher chaos of order 2 to any order. We also discuss applications for other complex functions of independent random variables, such as suprema of Boolean polynomials which include, as special cases, subgraph counting problems in random graphs.},

In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document.
